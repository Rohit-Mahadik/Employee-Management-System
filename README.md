🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: Employee Management System 🖥️
I've built an Employee Management System using Python and the Tkinter library for the UI. The system is connected to a MySQL database and includes several essential functionalities:
✅ Employee Registration: Easily register new employees.
🔄 Update/Delete Functionality: Update or remove employee details from the database.
🧹 Clear Functionality: Clear fields for quick and easy data input.
🔐 Login & Logout: Secure login/logout process for administrators.
🌟 This project allowed me to enhance my Python skills, explore the capabilities of Tkinter for building GUIs, and solidify my knowledge of database integration.
Looking forward to any feedback or suggestions! 💡
